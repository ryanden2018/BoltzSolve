Dicontinuous Galerkin solver for a smooth periodic convection diffusion
type PDE with possibly time-dependent uniform velocity field.
The basis is a (subset of a) tensor product basis of normalized Legendre polynomials.

This is intended to be run in a web browser and is compiled down
to WebAssembly from C++.
